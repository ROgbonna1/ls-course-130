On the introspective opener to his sophomore studio album, 21 Savage raps about having “a lot” of blessings and curses in his life. He reflects on his tumultuous upbringing, his dangerous lifestyle, and the pain and loss he has suffered.

21 calls on J. Cole to assist him on this track. In his verse, Cole reflects on his career, comments on the state of the music industry, and offers advice to athletes and other artists.
